Here is some of work related to embedded systems. I am using ATmega328P microcontroller by Microchip Technology. 

Datasheet of ATmega328P : https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf

This microcontroller comes in a 28-pin (DIP) and a 32-pin (TQPF/MLF) package. I am using a 28-pin one. This microcontroller is very popular because it is used in the Arduino UNO.
